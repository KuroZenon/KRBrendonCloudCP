You can also login to Studentlink, at Academic Matters, under Academic Mentoring System to view your mentor\u2019s information. Your mentor is here to give you advice on academic related matters. You should provide your contact and next-of-kin contact information to your mentor at the first meeting for subsequent communication and should the need arises in emergencies. Many important announcements are made through your NTU email account and so you should check and maintain your email account regularly.", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/short-term-internship-for-overseas-undergraduates", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/curriculum-structure", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/list-of-approved-calculators-registration-dates", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/laboratories-and-research-centres", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/view-and-download-programmes-brochure", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/about-us", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/about-us", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes#Content_C031_Col00", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes#Content_C032_Col00", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes#Content_C033_Col00", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes#Content_C034_Col00", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/research/research-groups", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/research/faculty-directory?searchFaculty=&interests=all&page=1", "Please visit this link:\nhttps://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/research/institutes-centres"],
